## Setup

#### Create a Deep Linked Ad Feed

Branch makes it easy for you to create and manage feeds with Facebook-compatible deep links.

1. Create a Branch Deep Linked Ad Feed from the [Partner Management page](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/partner-management){:target="_blank"}'s `Create Facebook Link` button under the Google Adwords Partner and select `Create Product Link`
<img src="/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/reusable-images/create-link-product.png" alt="Link Creation" class="three-quarters center">
1. Enter a Deep Linked Feed Name.
1. Enter a already set up feed source or upload a new source.
1. Configure the feed with the Ad Partner set to **Facebook**, and the Ad Format set to **Product**.
![Ad Link Setup](/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-dynamic-ads/feed-setup.png)
1. On the next section, select any keys from your feed that you'd like to include in the deep linked data contained in the generated links.
![Create Deep Linked Feed](/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-dynamic-ads/feed-keys-setup.png)
1. If you used a Feed Source hosted on a URL (recommended), you will see two options for accessing your feed. We recommend selecting “Schedule Refresh.” If you select this option, Branch will host a URL for your Deep Linked Feed that will update itself from your Feed Source URL at regular intervals.
![Deep Linked Feed Scheduling](/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-dynamic-ads/hosted-dlf.png)
1. Download the feed data or copy the deep linked feed URL (for hosted feeds) to be used in your Ad Campaign.

#### Upload your feed to Facebook

To set up a Facebook Product Catalogue campaign, you will need to first create your campaign and use a Branch link as the Deep Link URL for the advertisements. Facebook Dynamic Ads information is available **[here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/455326144628161){:target="_blank"}**.

1. Navigate to your [Facebook Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/){:target="_blank"}.
1. In the top left hand corner, click into the menu, select **All tools**, and select **Product Catalogues**.
![Facebook Product Catalogues](/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-dynamic-ads/fb-product-catalogs.png)
1. From the drop down menu click "Create new catalog...", name it (remember this name, you'll need it later) and select "Products sold online".
<img src="/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-dynamic-ads/create-new-catalog.png" alt="Facebook Create New Product Catalogue" class="half center">
1. Now that you have a product catalog, you can add a new feed. Click "Add Product Feed."
![Add New Feed](/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-dynamic-ads/add-new-feed.png)
1. If you have a [Hosted Deep Linked Feed](/features/deep-linked-feeds/guide/#schedule-refresh){:target="_blank"} (recommended), select the option "Scheduled recurring uploads." Paste your Branch-provided URL into the **Feed URL** text field.
![Feed URL option](/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-dynamic-ads/new-feed-settings.png)
![Feed URL settings](/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-dynamic-ads/upload-feed-url.png)
1. If you've created a Deep Linked Feed CSV file to upload, select the option "Single upload: Upload a single file feed now." Select the Deep Linked Feed URL or CSV file you would like to upload to Facebook, and click "Upload".
![Feed Uploaded](/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-dynamic-ads/successful-feed-upload.png)
1. Wait for the upload to complete successfully. If you'd like to create a "Product set" (a subset of products in your catalog for use in specific ad sets) you can do that now.

#### Setting up App Events and the Facebook Pixel

Facebook requires you to report events about your users interacting with your content, for example: viewing, adding to cart, and purchasing. To add the Facebook Pixel to your website, and the Facebook SDK to your app, follow these instructions:

- [Sending App Events with the Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events){:target="_blank"}
- [Sending Web Events with the Facebook Pixel](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/facebook-pixel/v2.8){:target="_blank"}

Use the "Product events" tab in your Product Catalog view to ensure that Facebook is registering the events against your Product Catalog items correctly.

#### Creating a Dynamic Ad Campaign

1. Navigate to [https://www.facebook.com/ads/create](https://www.facebook.com/ads/create){:target="_blank"} while logged in to the account that owns your Facebook app.
1. Choose **Product Catalog Sales**. Select the Product Catalog to which you uploaded your Deep Linked Feed.
![Feed Uploaded](/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/facebook-dynamic-ads/campaign-selection.png)
1. Select the targeting, bid, budget and placements that you'd like.
1. Select your desired ad format and launch your campaign. The Branch deep linked feed will be automatically set up in your Facebook product catalogue ads.

!!! note "Driving Installs with Dynamic Ads"
	By default, Facebook sends customers without the app to your mobile website. To drive installs, you can send customers without your app the app store by adding a `web_should_fallback` column to your Feed Source and setting each row to `false`. Then, after you've created your campaign, edit the ad within your ad set. Under "Creative," set your "App link destination" to "Deep link, app store backup."
