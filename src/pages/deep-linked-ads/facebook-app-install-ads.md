1. Under the Analytics Tags sub section additional tags can be set. It is recommended to fill in these fields as they can be used as filters in Branch's Ads Analytics view. To best connect your ad link with your Adwords Campaign, set the channel field to Facebook Ads and set the campaign field to the same ad campaign name used in Facebook Ads.

!!! warning ""
	In order for your campaign to run effectively, be sure to disable Deepviews. You can either [disable Deepviews](https://dev.branch.io/features/deepviews/guide/ios/ TODO) for your entire account or [disable Deepviews for one link]({{base.url}}/features/deepviews/advanced/ios/#disabling-deepviews-for-one-link TODO).

!!! note "Optional: Deep Link Data"
	You can use this configuration section to specify custom link parameters that will be deep linked into the app after install. These could include a coupon code or a page identifier to route the user. Visit the [Deep Link Routing](TODO) page to learn more.

!!! tip "Setting Attribution Windows"
	You can specify the attribution windows for your links either at an overall account or per link level. Use these windows to accurately measure attribution data for your Branch links. Refer to [Changing attribution windows](/pages/deep-linked-ads/branch-universal-ads/#change-attribution-windows) for instructions.

Your Facebook Ad Campaign is now setup to use Branch Links to handle App Installs!

!!! note "Optional: Ad formats with Multiple Links"
	Some ad formats such as Carousel format can handle multiple deep links. To have link performance data on each image or component of the advertisement, create multiple Branch Ad links to be used in each part of the multiple link advertisement format. This format is useful if you want to drive customers to different content pieces or products.
